1. The first thing I really liked about your website is your choice of colors! When loading up the home page, it looked very nice from the start and all of the colors blending really well with each other.
2. A pretty big difference I see between our websites is the way we did our home screens. I like how you did yours and I think it creates a better user experience because yours gives a brief explanation and a link whereas I put a lot of information on the home page. I think your code is more maintanable because I have some duplicated classes in my css files so I would have to change those classes in multiple different areas.
3. I believe your code is pretty well structured but I think you could make an html directory with everything but your index.html file just to organize it a bit better. You css and html files are named well and descriptive of their purpose.
4. Other than not having an html directory, I believe your structure and organization is very clean and readable, and would make it very easy for someone to pick up the project and make edits to it! I don't see any duplication and you use classes and IDs very effectively.
5. I am trying to look for things to be picky about but I honestly really like how you did most things on your website. I was a bit confused as to why products in the navbar was bolded compared to the other nav links so I think instead of it being bolded, you could have a down arrow or something to indicate its a list of nav-items.
