1. What did you like about this website?
    * I really like the overall look of the website. The color scheme is visually appealing and the style and fonts are very modern. The way that the home page is segmented and the nav bar disappears after a certain point is really cool. Also, having the nav bar with the dropdown menu for the products is very sleek. The content of the website is also very clever and funny.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    * One main difference between my page and theirs is the styling of the main page. I really like how their whole website is styled, but the way the main page is segmented and how the nav bar disappears after a certain point makes the site feel very modern. Something that I've learned is how to space out a sit better. I struggled to fit everything I wanted on a page, but I've learned that maybe I don't need all of the extra fluff, and that I should focus more on simplicity and easy of use.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    * The code is very well styled and very organized in the repository. There is not a lot of copy and pasted code and it seems like it would be easy to make changes if need be. The names of classes also make it really easy to look through the code. 

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    * I noticed that media queries were not used, so maybe add that to make the page more accessible for mobile. Other than that, everything else looked good!

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    *  Something that you might want to change is the gallery. I didn't realize that you had to scroll on the image to see more pictures. I would suggest making the gallery show all of the picture at once and not be a scroll box.
